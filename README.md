# ECE420_Final_Project_Acoustic_Noise_Suppression
We investigate several acoustic noise suppression methods that are based on spectrum subtractions, SNRs and Wiener filters. We implement them both on Python notebook and an Android tablet. We then try them out on human vioce mixed with different types of noise.
